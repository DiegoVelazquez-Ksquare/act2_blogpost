        <h1>San Francisco de Campeche</h1>

        <h2>Brief History </h2>
        <p>
            On October 4th in the year of 1540, it was founded the first village 
            by the spanish people, and that city was Campeche or formally address as San Francisco de Campeche. 
            Before that it was a maya civilization which served as a transit place for the Itzaes and Xilues who lived
             in the well-known Chichen-Itza and Uxmal. Its maya name was Ah kim pech which means city of snakes and ticks.

        <h2>Food Recomendations </h2>
        <p>
            Campeche and Yucatan share a lot of food in common since both are from Yucatan Peninsula so at least for me a
            characteristic food from here that I really like is Pan de Cazon. This is basically a stack up of corn tortilla,
            fry beans, tomato sauce, Cazon (which is a type of shark commonly eat here) and habanero.
